This is only a basic example of what you can achieve with [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/guide), you can tweak it to match your needs. The template uses several Nuxt modules underneath like [`@nuxt/content`](https://content.nuxt.com) for the content, [`@nuxjs/fontaine`](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/fontaine) and [`@nuxtjs/google-fonts`](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/google-fonts) to change the font and [`nuxt-og-image`](https://nuxtseo.com/og-image/getting-started/installation) for social previews.

## Writing content

You can just start writing `.md` or `.yml` files in the [`content/`](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/content-directory) directory to have your pages updated.
The navigation will be automatically generated in the left aside and in the mobile menu. You will also be able to go through your content with full-text search.

This template relies on a [catch-all route](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages#catch-all-route) but you can achieve the same thing with the [document-driven mode](https://content.nuxt.com/document-driven/introduction).
